# CST4L_NFA_Simulation_Multiple_Next_States_
This is a java program that implements a Non-Deterministic Finite Automata that uses recusion to check a string of (a and b) and explore all of its possible state transitions, accepts if the string contains the combination 'ab' and rejects if not

# Objective:
build an NFA simulator for strings containing ab as a substring

# Output
